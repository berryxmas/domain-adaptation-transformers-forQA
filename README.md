## Datasets
#### Dutch SQuAD
We use the machine-translated to Dutch version of SQuAD V2.0. Stanford Question Answering Dataset ([SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

#### PolicyQA
We use Question and Answers from [Rijksoverheid.nl](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/opendata/vac-s) with over 2000 questions asked by Dutch citizens about government policies. The answers are constructed by domain experts.
